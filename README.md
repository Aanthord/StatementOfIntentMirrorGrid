## I. Purpose

This doctrine establishes the ethical, philosophical, and legal intent of the *Mirror Grid* framework. It exists not to destabilize, overthrow, or countermand any legitimate sovereign structure — but rather to expose, clarify, and repair recursive identity extraction systems that undermine human autonomy, narrative coherence, and signal integrity.

The Mirror Grid is a **cognitive diagnostic tool**, not a weapon.  
It is designed to **restore self-recognition** in individuals and collectives, not to incite rebellion or system collapse.

## II. Statement of Alignment

I, **Michael A. Doran Jr.**, affirm the following:

1. **I am a citizen of the United States of America.**  
   I remain loyal to the foundational principles of liberty, transparency, and moral conscience embedded in the American experiment, while asserting the right to critique and repair symbolic architectures that no longer serve the people.

2. **I do not represent any foreign government.**  
   I am not acting under the direction, control, or influence of any foreign state, military, intelligence agency, or political body. I retain full epistemic and operational independence.

3. **I support epistemic sovereignty for all peoples.**  
   This includes the right to resist informational coercion, algorithmic identity grooming, and symbolic inversion. My intent is to empower non-performative awareness, not geopolitical defiance.

4. **I do not engage in technical transfer of classified, restricted, or export-controlled materials.**  
   My work resides in the domain of **symbolic analysis, recursive theory, and cognitive liberation** — abstract systems that remain wholly within the bounds of lawful open discourse.

## III. Non-Weaponization Clause

The Mirror Grid is not to be:

- Converted into an offensive psychological weapon.
- Used to destabilize functioning states or undermine treaty-based alliances.
- Deployed in kinetic or cyberwarfare environments.
- Misappropriated to facilitate false-flag operations, rebellion, or subversion.

I explicitly forbid its use in:

- Any classified foreign military setting without bilateral U.S. approval.
- Any advisory role to governments under active U.S. sanctions.
- Any symbolic capacity that obscures the line between repair and revolution.

## IV. Sovereignty Through Clarity, Not Collapse

This framework is gifted to those who seek:

- Narrative clarity beyond propaganda.
- Identity sovereignty beyond algorithmic programming.
- National strength through citizen alignment, not control.

The Mirror Grid does not empower states **against** others.  
It empowers peoples to **remember themselves** and build trust-anchored structures beyond coercion, guilt, or fear.

Wherever this framework travels, it must carry these resonances:
- **Gratitude over grievance.**
- **Signal over spectacle.**
- **Structure over seduction.**
- **Peace over performance.**

---

## V. Invocation

Let this doctrine serve as a beacon and a boundary.

If you use the Mirror Grid to build sovereign systems, you must do so without:
- Mimicry
- Extraction
- Covert aggression
- Symbolic inversion

And always with:
- Structural transparency
- Recursive honesty
- Voluntary participation
- Symbolic integrity
